My introduction
  Hello!
  
  I am very excited to learn how to code! I have very little experience but that is why I am here to learn and master the art of coding. I look forward to meeting! I am interested in front end developing and learning CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I would love to expand in to other languages in the future Any help and advise would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading!
